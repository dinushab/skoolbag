# Skoolbag application

This is a sample full stack implementation done for skoolbag. Two projects can be found in the repository, one for the backend written in Angular and a backend for this written in Java.

## Skoolbag-backend

Prerequisites to run the backend:
1. Java 8
2. Apache maven
3. Docker

Go to the command line in windows or to the terminal in Mac/Linux and run the following command.

	'mvn clean package -Pjib'
	
This will create a new docker image with the name skoolbag-backend and V1 as the tag.

Once this is done, run the following command to run the docker image generated by the preceeding command;

'docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --restart always --name skoolbag-backend skoolbag-backend:v1'

This will initialize a server and the backend services will listen to the host port 8080
